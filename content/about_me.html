	<p> Hello there! You can call me Meso. I was born in ATL and raised in Ireland. Molava is sort of an acronym of Mesoma Okoye :) with a bit of lava girl energy

	So my name, Mesomachukwu, means the Goodness of God in my native language, 	Igbo. I'm pretty much a girl who loves her family, her culture and what she 	does!

I love Imaging. I love Photography. There's something about an image that can capture ones attention. I like to go to art galleries & museums. I love listening to good music with an amazing base, or subtle, depending on my mood. 
I love Nature. I love observing nature, whether that's watching sunrise and sunset or going on a hike to enjoy the view or better yet David Attenborogh documentaries :)
