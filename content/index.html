	<p> <h2> <u> New Job</u> </h2> 
	So I just started my career and its terrifying but exciting!<br>
	After grad school i decided to take a couple months off, travelling & relaxing. <br>
	It took me a while to settle into the job hunting lifestule of ups and downs and emotional rollercoasters but i did it & landed an amazing job :) <br>
	It feels good to know that I'm doing what I love; exeriments!
	</p>

	<h2> <u> New Skill </u> </h2> 
	Ahhhh! xD So as well as starting a new position, I decided to lean into the 	spring season and learn something new. I joined this bootcamp called Kickstart 	Coding in Oakland that teaches us the coding fundamentals as well as Frontend 	and Backend programs.<br>
	Isn't that exciting! I know it might be a lot lol starting my first biotech job and learning to code but hey I love challenges. I know it's going to be difficult but when the going gets tough, you think about the end result of learning a new skill <3 

	<p><h2> <u> Almost New Apartment </u> </h2>
	Soo, I'm currently hunting for apartments in the Bay. And its hard to find a place that ticks my enormous boxes, however I'm optimistic to the tea that I'll find it :) My treasure awaits in Craigslist...
